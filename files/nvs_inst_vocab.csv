By measuring the time of flight of the pulse in both directions, the velocity component of the air flow along the line of the transducer pair can be determined. This measurement is carried out for each of the three transducer pairs in turn. A mathematical transformation is then performed, to convert the resulting three wind vectors into U,V,W format."

"L22/NETT0147","Reeve Net","L05/22","plankton nets","ReeveNet","A Reeve Net is a conventional ring net with a very large acrylic cylindrical cod-end (30 liters) designed to collect fragile gelatinous animals. The net is lowered to a particular depth and then hauled slowly back to the surface (5-10 m/min). Reeve (1981) also described a double net system with no bridle and flotation at the net mouth that is attached to a roller mechanism that rides on a tow wire. The roller system is locked in place by a pressure release device. Once below a set pressure, the roller and nets are released and they float slowly up the wire, gently collecting the zooplankton, without being influenced by the motion of the vessel and associated vertical wire movements.
