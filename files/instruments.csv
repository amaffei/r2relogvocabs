Using the phase-shift acoustic transit-time measurement technique, the 2D-ACM is an easy-to-use, high accuracy current meter, with no moving parts and a finite measurement volume. The phase-shift measurement principle allows the 2D-ACM to measure accurately, even in slow moving water and in water with no reflectors present (e.g. deep water). Internal compass and tilt sensors provide magnetic horizontal current vector direction, without the need for specific orientation of the current meter during deployment.  http://www.falmouth.com/support/technicalpapers.html"

"R2RE/9064","OOIAST2: OOI AST2 Hybrid Profiler Mooring SIO","R2RE/1019","mooring","OOIAST2","The OOI At-Sea-Test 2 (AST2) Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring was deployed on Sept. 26. 2011 in approximately 2500 meters of water at a latitude of 39 degree North near the Pioneer Area which is south of Woods Hole. The Global Hybrid Profiler Mooring (GHPM) consists of a Surface Piercing Profiler (SPP or SeaCycler) to perform profiling measurements in the upper 150m of the water column and a Wire Following Profiler (WFP or McLane Moored Profiler) which takes profiling measurements 3 times per day between 300m to 2300m. Communication between the SPP and the lower part of the mooring (including the WFP) takes place inductively via the SIO controller in 2285m depth which collects all data and passes them to the SPP. The data from all these instruments get transmitted to shore through the satellite communication link of the Surface Piercing Profiler. The AST2 GHPM is a prototype of the Global GHPM moorings that will be deployed at the four Global OOI sites.  http://mooring.ucsd.edu/index.html?/projects/ooi/ooi_data.html"

"L22/NETT0147","Reeve Net","L05/22","plankton nets","ReeveNet","A Reeve Net is a conventional ring net with a very large acrylic cylindrical cod-end (30 liters) designed to collect fragile gelatinous animals. The net is lowered to a particular depth and then hauled slowly back to the surface (5-10 m/min). Reeve (1981) also described a double net system with no bridle and flotation at the net mouth that is attached to a roller mechanism that rides on a tow wire. The roller system is locked in place by a pressure release device. Once below a set pressure, the roller and nets are released and they float slowly up the wire, gently collecting the zooplankton, without being influenced by the motion of the vessel and associated vertical wire movements.

"L22/TOOL0266","Sea-Bird SBE 39 temperature recorder","L05/134","water temperature sensor","SBE 39 TR","A high-accuracy temperature recorder (pressure optional) with internal battery and non-volatile memory for deployment at depths up to 10500 meters. It is intended for moorings or other long-term, fixed-site applications, as well as shorter-term deployments on nets, towed vehicles or ROVs. Calibration coefficients stored in EEPROM allow the SBE 39 to transmit data in engineering units. The SBE 39 thermistor has a long history of exceptional accuracy and stability (typical drift is less than 0.002C per year). The SBE 39 communicates directly with a computer via a standard RA-232 interface. For more information see http://www.bodc.ac.uk/data/documents/nodb/108627/"

It uses an Overhauser sensor that allows omnidirectional data collection regardless of the direction of the ambient magnetic field. The sensor is accurate to 0.1 nT with a resolution of 0.01 nT. The magnetometer and associated electronics are held in a fibreglass towfish and the SeaSPY is available in three depth ratings: 1000 m, 3000 m and 6000 m. Optional extras include a pressure sensor, altimeter, transponder and side scan integration."
"R2RE/9069","Sediment Trap","L054/33","sediment traps","SedimentTrap","Sediment traps are specially designed containers deployed in the water column for periods of time to collect particles from the water column falling toward the sea floor. In general a sediment trap has a jar at the bottom to collect the sample and a broad funnel-shaped opening at the top with baffles to keep out very large objects and help prevent the funnel from clogging. This designation is used when the specific type of sediment trap was not specified by the contributing investigator."

The modern drifter is a high-tech version of the message in a bottle. It consists of a surface buoy and a subsurface drogue (sea anchor), attached by a long, thin tether. The buoy measures temperature and other properties, and has a transmitter to send the data to passing satellites. The drogue dominates the total area of the instrument and is centered at a depth of 15 meters beneath the sea surface.   Lumpkin, R. and M.
