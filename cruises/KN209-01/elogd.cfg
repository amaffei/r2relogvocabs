Scientists use the instrument to measure how fast water is moving across an entire water column. An ADCP anchored to the seafloor can measure current speed not just at the bottom, but also at equal intervals all the way up to the surface. The instrument can also be mounted horizontally on seawalls or bridge pilings in rivers and canals to measure the current profile from shore to shore, and to the bottoms of ships to take constant current measurements as the boats move. In very deep areas, they can be lowered on a cable from the surface.  The ADCP measures water currents with sound (75kHz), using a principle of sound waves called the Doppler effect.","ADCP75","start;stop;service;other","0"

It has a bottom track range of 200m and velocity accuracy for both bottom and water track modes is 0.4% of the velocity, Â±0.2cm/s. The instrument operates effectively over a temperature range of -5Â°C to 45Â°C and with a tilt of up to Â±15 deg.","ADCP300","start;stop;service;other","0"
